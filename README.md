# Node JS Project Runner similar to Nodemon

Creation of you own personal project runner. In this project I build a command line application that's going to watch for changes inside of or project directory any time shomething change.

It is like a the nodemon package, but much simple. 


##### In this project use:
* nodejs standard package (util, path, file system)
* library chalk to color the output in the cmd
* loops, Promises, async and await
* forEach method
* nmp link
* npm init
